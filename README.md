# make87

**Secure, outbound-only access to physical devices — with a native-feeling development, debugging, and software deployment experience.**

m87 is a lightweight **CLI + agent** for connecting to, debugging, and deploying software to distributed hardware fleets — all over a single outbound connection and without VPNs or inbound firewalls.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Try in 5 minutes)

### 1. Install the CLI

Install the CLI on both your **developer machine** and the **edge device**.

#### ⚡ One-liner (recommended)

Installs the latest version to `$HOME/.local/bin`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.make87.com | sh
```

<details>

**From releases**

Download a pre-built binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/make87/make87/releases) and place it in your `$PATH` (e.g., `$HOME/.local/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`).

**From source**

Build the binary and move it to a location in your `$PATH`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/make87/make87.git
cd make87
cargo build --release
cp target/release/m87 $HOME/.local/bin/
```

</details>

### 2. Set up your developer machine

Login to create your account (opens browser for OAuth):

```bash
m87 login
```

### 3. Set up the edge device

On the edge device, start the agent:

```bash
m87 agent run --email you@example.com
```

This registers the device (printing a request ID) and waits for approval. Once approved, the agent starts automatically.

### 4. Approve the device

On your developer machine, approve the pending device:

```bash
m87 devices approve <request-id>
```

*(You can also approve via the web UI.)*

Once approved, you can interact with your device:

```bash
m87 devices list
m87 <device> shell
m87 <device> docker ps
```

Now you're connected — no inbound access, no firewall rules, and no VPN required.

👀 Try this next:

* forward a local port to a remote service
* run an IDE remote development session

## ✨ What Makes m87 Different

m87 isn’t *just* remote access — it’s designed so **working with real devices feels like local development and deployment**:

* **Outbound-only access:** works behind NATs / firewalls without opening inbound ports.
* **Native dev experience:** shell, port/sockets forwarding, logs, and live debugging feel like you’re working locally.
* **Deployment-ready:** one CLI that transitions from access to orchestrating software deployments across fleets.

If you’ve ever SSH’d into an embedded device only to run into network traps or scaling pain, m87 makes those workflows easy and repeatable.

---

## 🧱 Core Concepts

### 🛠 Development & Debugging

Use native OS tools and IDEs as if the device were local:

```bash
# Run shell
m87 <device> shell

# Forward a port for a debugging server
m87 <device> forward 8080:localhost:3000
```

### 📦 Software Deployment

Deploy containers and services using familiar commands:

```bash
m87 <device> docker compose up -d
```

(*More deployment commands and flags coming soon.*)
