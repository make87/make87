# m87

CLI for [make87](https://make87.com).

## Overview

m87 connects edge devices to the make87 platform and provides remote access to them.

**On edge devices**: Run the m87 runtime to register the device and accept incoming connections.

**From your workstation**: Use m87 to access registered devices — shell, port forwarding, file transfer, container
management.

## Requirements

- Linux (amd64, arm64) — CLI and runtime
- macOS (amd64, arm64) — CLI only

## Install

Linux:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://get.make87.com | sh
```

Or download from [releases](https://github.com/make87/make87/releases).

## Quick Start

```sh
m87 login                      # authenticate via browser
m87 devices list               # list accessible devices
m87 <device> shell             # open shell on device
m87 <device> forward 8080      # forward port 8080
```

## Commands

### Remote Device Access

```
m87 <device> status            # status of the device (crashes, health and incidents)
m87 <device> shell             # interactive shell
m87 <device> exec -- <cmd>     # run command
m87 <device> forward <ports>   # port forwarding (see below)
m87 <device> docker <args>     # docker passthrough
m87 <device> logs              # logs from the runtime and observed containers
m87 <device> stats             # system metrics
m87 <device> serial <name>     # serial mount forwarding
m87 <device> audit --details   # audit logs on who interacted with the device
```

### Async Deployment

In case your devices are not always online, you can register jobs
to be executed when the device comes online.
With this you can deploy arbitrary runtimes like docker systemd servers etc
or observe services and get notified upon events.

```
m87 <device> deploy ./my-compose.yml             # register a docker compsoe file to be run and observed (Auto converted by our cli)
m87 <device> undeploy my-compose                 # remove the compose spec fomr the current deployment
m87 <device> deploy ./custom_run_spec.yml        # register a custom run spec. See docs for schema
m87 <device> deployment status --logs            # get the status and logs of the currently active deployment
m87 <device> deployment show --yaml              # show the yaml spec of the currently active deployment
```

### File Transfer

```
m87 cp <device>:/path ./local  # copy from device
m87 cp ./local <device>:/path  # copy to device
m87 sync ./src <device>:/dst   # rsync-style sync
m87 sync --watch ./src <device>:/dst
```

## SSH

```
m87 ssh enable                 # enable ssh host resolving
ssh <device>.m87               # now you can use ssh like you would normally
```

### Device Management

```
m87 login                       # authenticate via browser
m87 logout                      # clear local credentials
m87 devices list                # list accessible devices
m87 devices approve <device>    # approve a pending device registration
```

### Updating

```sh
m87 update                      # download and install the latest m87 binary
```

After updating, restart the runtime to use the new version:

```sh
m87 runtime restart             # restart the runtime service
```

**Note:** If you're running `m87 runtime restart` from within a device shell (e.g., via `m87 <device> shell`), the command will fail because the shell is a subprocess of the runtime being restarted. Use `systemd-run` to run the restart in an independent scope:

```sh
sudo -v && systemd-run --scope m87 runtime restart
```

The `sudo -v` prompts for your password upfront, then `systemd-run --scope` creates a transient scope outside the runtime's cgroup, allowing the restart to complete successfully.

### Running as Runtime (Linux)

To make a device remotely accessible:

```sh
m87 runtime run --email you@example.com   # register and run runtime (waits for approval)
```

Then approve the device from your workstation with `m87 devices approve <request-id>`.

#### Systemd Service

```sh
m87 runtime start           # enable at boot and start immediately
m87 runtime stop            # stop the service (keeps enabled at boot)
m87 runtime restart         # restart the service (starts if stopped)
m87 runtime status          # show service status
m87 runtime enable          # enable at boot (without starting)
m87 runtime enable --now    # enable at boot and start immediately
m87 runtime disable         # disable at boot (keeps running)
m87 runtime disable --now   # disable at boot and stop
```

The CLI automatically handles privilege escalation by invoking `sudo`. The runtime service runs as your user, not root.

**Command behavior:**
- `start` / `enable --now`: Installs the service file, enables it to start on boot, and starts it immediately
- `stop`: Stops the running service but keeps it enabled for next boot
- `restart`: Matches systemd behavior — restarts if running, starts if stopped
- `enable`: Only enables the service to start on boot (doesn't start it now)
- `disable`: Only disables the service from starting on boot (doesn't stop it now)

## Port Forwarding

Format: `[local:]remote[/protocol]`

```sh
m87 <device> forward 8080              # localhost:8080 → device:8080
m87 <device> forward 3000:8080         # localhost:3000 → device:8080
m87 <device> forward 192.168.1.5:80    # forward to host on device's LAN
m87 <device> forward 8080/udp          # UDP (default: tcp)
m87 <device> forward 8080 9090 3000    # multiple ports
```
