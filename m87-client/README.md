# m87

CLI for [make87](https://make87.com).

## Overview

m87 connects edge devices to the make87 platform and provides remote access to them.

**On edge devices**: Run the m87 runtime to register the device and accept incoming connections.

**From your workstation**: Use m87 to access registered devices — shell, port forwarding, file transfer, container
management.

## Requirements

- Linux (amd64, arm64) — CLI and runtime
- macOS (amd64, arm64) — CLI only

## Install

Linux:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://get.make87.com | sh
```

Or download from [releases](https://github.com/make87/make87/releases).

## Quick Start

```sh
m87 login                      # authenticate via browser
m87 devices list               # list accessible devices
m87 <device> shell             # open shell on device
m87 <device> forward 8080      # forward port 8080
```

## Commands

### Remote Device Access

```
m87 <device> status            # status of the device (crashes, health and incidents)
m87 <device> shell             # interactive shell
m87 <device> exec -- <cmd>     # run command
m87 <device> forward <ports>   # port forwarding (see below)
m87 <device> docker <args>     # docker passthrough
m87 <device> logs              # logs from the runtime and observed containers
m87 <device> metrics           # system metrics
m87 <device> serial <name>     # serial mount forwarding
m87 <device> audit --details   # audit logs on who interacted with the device
```

### Async Deployment

In case your devices are not always online, you can register jobs
to be executed when the device comes online.
With this you can deploy arbitrary runtimes like docker systemd servers etc
or observe services and get notified upon events.

```
m87 <device> deploy ./my-compose.yml             # register a docker compsoe file to be run and observed (Auto converted by our cli)
m87 <device> undeploy my-compose                 # remove the compose spec fomr the current deployment
m87 <device> deploy ./custom_run_spec.yml        # register a custom run spec. See docs for schema
m87 <device> deployment status --logs            # get the status and logs of the currently active deployment
m87 <device> deployment show --yaml              # show the yaml spec of the currently active deployment
```

### File Transfer

```
m87 cp <device>:/path ./local  # copy from device
m87 cp ./local <device>:/path  # copy to device
m87 sync ./src <device>:/dst   # rsync-style sync
m87 sync --watch ./src <device>:/dst
```

## SSH

```
m87 ssh enable                 # enable ssh host resolving
ssh <device>.m87               # now you can use ssh like you would normally
```

### Device Management

```
m87 login
m87 logout
m87 devices list
m87 devices approve <device>
m87 update
```

### Running as Runtime (Linux)

To make a device remotely accessible:

```sh
m87 runtime run --email you@example.com   # register and run runtime (waits for approval)
```

Then approve the device from your workstation with `m87 devices approve <request-id>`.

#### Systemd Service

```sh
m87 runtime enable --now    # install, enable and start (prompts for sudo)
m87 runtime status          # show service status
m87 runtime stop            # stop the service
m87 runtime disable --now   # disable and stop
```

The CLI automatically handles privilege escalation invoking `sudo`. The runtime service runs as your user, not root.

## Port Forwarding

Format: `[local:]remote[/protocol]`

```sh
m87 <device> forward 8080              # localhost:8080 → device:8080
m87 <device> forward 3000:8080         # localhost:3000 → device:8080
m87 <device> forward 192.168.1.5:80    # forward to host on device's LAN
m87 <device> forward 8080/udp          # UDP (default: tcp)
m87 <device> forward 8080 9090 3000    # multiple ports
```
